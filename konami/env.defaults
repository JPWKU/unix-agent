# This file gets executed on the docker container, hence some of 
# the weird indirection.

# Developers will almost certainly want to define some of these
# variables by setting the same exact variable name in their own
# environment.  SSH is a good example.

# The build.sh script takes care of producing the final env.sh
# which is copied to the container.

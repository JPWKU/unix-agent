# HOW TO EXTEND THESE SCRIPT (aka DO NOT EDIT ANY SCRIPTS)
#
# You can extend or replace these script by setting up your own executables in
# /dcm/custom/bin:
# * /dcm/custom/bin/<script name> - if exists, will completely replace this script
# * /dcm/custom/bin/<script name>-pre - if exists, will be executed before this script
# * /dcm/custom/bin/<script name>-post - if exists, will be executed after this script
# Your custom commands will be called with the same arguments in the same order as
# this script.
